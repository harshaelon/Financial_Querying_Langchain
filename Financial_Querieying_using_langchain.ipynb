You may save one copy of the guide to\\ndisk, and print one copy out for your personal use. You may not make more than one copy without\\nour permission.\\nIntroduction\\nPlain English Campaign brings light to technical language which is dark and troubling for many\\npeople. This excellent guide will help ordinary people understand financial, tax and legal\\ndocuments. It will also help and encourage those who write such documents to use language which\\nthe intended audience can understand. The guide shows that there is no need for technical\\nlanguage to baffle and befuddle.\\nWe all have much to learn from this guide. And we all have much to thank Plain English Campaign\\nfor. Over the years the Campaign has made a valuable difference to the way government and\\nbusiness communicate with people. It has helped people to understand their rights and duties. This\\nguide is a further important milestone.\\nMark H Ashworth\\nHead of Group Pensions\\nNat West GroupPlain English Campaign: The A to Z of financial terms\\n1We have written this A to Z guide to help you to understand some of the terms you will come\\nacross when you buy a house, go into business, take out insurance, invest your money and do all\\nthe other things you might have to do in your lifetime. It should help you to unravel the language\\nyou may not come across very often in your day−to−day life.\\nAbsolute owner\\nThis is the sole owner of a piece of property, such as a building, vehicle or piece of equipment.\\nAbstract of title\\nThis is a document which summarises all the  title deeds to a property such as a house. It is drawn\\nup for the seller when a property is being sold.\\nAccounting date\\nOrganisations prepare their  annual accounts covering a period of 12 months. The last day of the\\nperiod is called the accounting date.\\nAccrual rate\\nThis is the rate by which a pension from an  earnings−related occupational pension scheme\\nbuilds up from one year to another. The rate is shown as a fraction or a percentage of the\\nmember's final yearly salary.\\nAccrue\\nIf something is accruing, it is building up day by day. If an organisation owes money for goods and\\nservices but has not received a bill up to the date it prepares its accounts, it will estimate what it\\nowes. It will then include the debt in its accounts. This estimated  liability is called an accrual.\\nAccrued income security\\nThis is a security (investment) which pays interest at regular intervals. When it is sold, interest may\\nhave built up and this interest will be paid to the new owner. Interest built up like this is called\\naccrued interest.\\nAccumulation date\\nThis is the date when income will be  credited to a  unit trust which reinvests its income (an\\naccumulation unit), instead of paying the income out to the investors.\\nAccumulation unit\\nThe type of  unit trust which reinvests the income it earns, instead of paying it out immediately to\\nthe investors, is called an accumulation unit.\\nActuaryPlain English Campaign: The A to Z of financial terms\\n2An actuary is an expert on pension scheme  assets and  liabilities, life expectancy and\\nprobabilities for insurance purposes (the likelihood of things happening). An actuary works out\\nwhether enough money is being paid into a pension scheme to pay the pensions when they are\\ndue.\\nAd valorem\\nIf a duty is ad valorem the duty varies with the price of the  asset which is being transferred.\\nAdditional voluntary contribution\\nPeople in occupational pension schemes can pay in extra money to increase their  pension\\nbenefits.

It is quoted by financial institutions, such as banks, to show\\nhow much the interest rate would be if the interest was worked out just once a year. It is intended to\\nmake it easier for people to judge how much interest they pay (or receive) when it is being worked\\nout more than once a year. It is also intended to make it easier to compare different financial\\nproducts.\\nAffidavit\\nAn affidavit is a written statement which is sworn to be true by the person signing it. It is sworn\\nbefore someone authorised by the court.\\nAllocation ratePlain English Campaign: The A to Z of financial terms\\n3When money is paid into a fund (such as a pension fund) the allocation rate is the percentage of\\nthe money left which can be invested after the charges have been taken off.

The annual accounts are presented for approval at this meeting.\\nAnnual management charge\\nThis is a yearly charge made by the managers of  unit trusts or  investment trusts. It is usually a\\npercentage of the value of the funds being managed.\\nAnnual payment\\nAn annual payment is an amount paid out every year, such as an annuity. It may be split up into\\nsmaller amounts and be paid out more frequently than once a year.\\nAnnuity\\nAn annuity is an amount paid out every year to someone. The money usually comes from an\\ninsurance policy. It can be split up into smaller amounts and paid out more frequently, such as\\nmonthly.

This is called a balloon payment.\\nBankruptcy\\nIf someone cannot pay their debts when they are due to be paid, a court may issue a bankruptcy\\norder against them. This order takes ownership of the  debtor's property away from the debtor and\\nallows much of the property to be sold. The money raised is divided between the  creditorsPlain English Campaign: The A to Z of financial terms\\n6following strict rules.\\nBare trustee\\nA bare trustee holds property ‘on  trust' for another person until asked to return the property.\\nBarter\\nThis is a way of paying for things, without using money, by exchanging goods.\\nBasic−rate tax\\nOnce you have used up all your  tax allowances and all your lower−rate tax band, you pay\\nbasic−rate tax.

This includes things like education, healthcare, infrastructure, and national defense. Without sufficient tax revenue, a government may struggle to meet these obligations and maintain a stable economy.\\n\\nTaxation policy also serves as a tool for government to influence economic behavior. By adjusting tax rates and implementing incentives or penalties, governments can encourage or discourage certain activities, such as investment, consumption, and saving. This can have a significant impact on the overall health and growth of the economy.\\n\\nOverall, taxation policy is essential for the functioning of a government and the economy.
